# Student-Performance-project

In this project i am talking about student performance prediction that based on several factors such as :

1) How many hours the student studied ?
2) what is his previous score ?
3) does he have an extracurricular activites ?
4) How many hours does he sleep?
5) How many sample question papers he had practiced ?
6) finially his performance index and this column we should predict it


python packages :

1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib.pyplot
4) seaborn
5) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
6) from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
7) from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
8) from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error

questions :

1) Import the dataset?
2) Get a statistical summary ?
3) check if there is any missing values?
4) Make a histplot about the Extracurricular activites between all the columns and its counts ?
5) Make a plot with two categories yes or no between all the columns and its counts ?
6) Make a plot called scatter between the the hours studied and the performance index?
7) Make a barplot to see if a student have any extracurricular activites will increase the performance and vice versa?
8) Make a plot to see the average performance by hours studied?
9) Make a heatmap between all the columns to see the correlation?
10) Make a violinplot between the performance level and sample question papers practiced?
11) Make a pairplot to all the columns of the data?
12) Make a pairplot to all the columns of the data but based on extracurricular activities?
13) Make a scatterplot between previous score and the performance index?
14) Make a catplot between all the columns with the performance index that based on extracurricular activities?
15) Make a lineplot btween the average performance index and hours studied based on extracurricular activities?
16) Make a displot to all the columns based on extracurricular activities?
17) Get the heatmap for all the correlations?
18) Make a heatmap to visualze for target correlation with features?
19) Visualize the top 10% ranked student with catplot between all the columns with the performance index based on extracurricular activities ?
20) Make a scatterplot between previous scores and the performance index?
21) Train a model to predict the performance of the student by using train test split ?
22) Fit the model by using linear regression ?
23) Make a dataframe that contain the actual performance and the predicted performance?
24) Get the mean squared error and the R square ?
25) Get the model equation coefficent and its intercept ?
26) Get the accuracy for the train and the test?
27) Make a plot betweeen the actual value and the predicted value?
28) Make a painplot about the actual value and the predicted value?
